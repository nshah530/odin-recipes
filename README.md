# odin-recipes
Part 1 Before: 
This is a website about recipes. After completing this project,
I will have demonstrated basic HTML skills, including using an
HTML boilerplate, creating different headings, including links
and images, and formatting. I will also have created my first 
multifile project on GitHub.
